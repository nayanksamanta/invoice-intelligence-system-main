# Project Overview

The **Vendor Invoice Intelligence System** is an end-to-end Machine Learning project developed to automate vendor invoice analysis for finance and operations teams.

The system focuses on two major business problems:

- Predicting expected freight costs for vendor invoices
- Automatically identifying risky or suspicious invoices that may require manual review

The project combines:
- SQL-based data extraction,
- Feature engineering,
- Statistical analysis,
- Machine Learning modeling,
- Hyperparameter tuning,
- Inference pipelines,
- Streamlit-based deployment

to build a production-oriented intelligent invoice processing system.

# Business Problem

Organizations process thousands of vendor invoices regularly. Manual invoice verification is often:

- Time-consuming,
- Error-prone,
- Difficult to scale,
- Inefficient for anomaly detection.

Additionally:
- Freight costs are difficult to estimate manually,
- Abnormal invoices may go unnoticed,
- Financial mismatches can impact operational efficiency.

This project addresses these challenges using Machine Learning-based automation.

---

# Business Objectives

The primary objectives of the system are:

- Predict expected freight cost using invoice information
- Automatically flag suspicious invoices
- Reduce manual review workload
- Improve operational efficiency
- Assist finance teams in identifying anomalies early
- Support intelligent invoice validation workflows

---

# Streamlit Web Application

A Streamlit-based interactive application was developed for business users.

### Features
- Freight Cost Prediction
- Invoice Risk Detection
- Interactive UI
- Real-time prediction system

# Dataset and Database

## Data Source
Relational SQLite Database

---

## Tables Used

### Purchase Table

Contains:
- Purchase order number
- Quantity
- Dollars
- Receiving date
- Purchase order date
- Brand information

---

### Vendor Invoice Table

Contains:
- Invoice quantity
- Invoice dollars
- Freight cost
- Invoice date
- Payment date

---

# SQL Data Extraction

Data was extracted using:

```python
pd.read_sql_query()
```

SQL operations used:
- `SUM()`
- `AVG()`
- `COUNT()`
- `GROUP BY`
- `LEFT JOIN`

---

# Feature Engineering

Several business-focused features were created, including:

- Total item quantity
- Total item dollars
- Total brands
- Average receiving delay
- Days from PO to Invoice
- Days to Payment

---

# Date Handling

Date columns were originally stored as object/string format.

The SQLite `julianday()` function was used to:
- Convert dates,
- Calculate delays,
- Generate time-based analytical features.

Example:
```sql
julianday(receiving_date) - julianday(po_date)
```

---

# Label Creation for Classification

Supervised Machine Learning requires labeled target variables.

Invoices were flagged using rule-based business conditions:

### Invoice flagged if:
- Invoice total mismatch exists
OR
- Average receiving delay > 10 days

### Labels
| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 1 | Risky Invoice |
| 0 | Normal Invoice |

---

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to:
- Understand invoice behavior,
- Detect correlations,
- Identify feature importance,
- Compare risky vs normal invoices.

### Techniques Used
- Correlation heatmaps
- Statistical analysis
- Distribution plots
- T-Test hypothesis testing

---

# Statistical Testing

T-Test was applied to compare:
- Risky invoices
- Normal invoices

### Purpose
Identify statistically significant features.

### Decision Rule
- `p-value < 0.05` → Significant Feature
- `p-value > 0.05` → Non-significant Feature

Features such as:
- Days to Pay
- Total Brands

were removed due to low significance.

---

# Feature Scaling

Since feature ranges varied significantly:
- Dollars in millions
- Delays in days

Feature scaling was required.

### Scaling Techniques Used
- StandardScaler
- MinMaxScaler

---

# Machine Learning Models Used

| Model | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | Baseline model |
| Decision Tree Classifier | Rule-based classification |
| Random Forest Classifier | Final optimized model |
